    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Technology (MSc IT) and am in my second year. 
        My academic focus includes Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, and 
        Blockchain Technology. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions that drive 
        business success and am constantly expanding my skill set to stay ahead in the rapidly 
        evolving tech landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey in IT began with a strong foundation in programming and software development, 
        which I have built upon with hands-on experience in cloud-based applications, machine learning 
        models, and data-driven decision-making. I am committed to leveraging technology to solve 
        complex problems and improve processes, making a tangible impact in the corporate world.
